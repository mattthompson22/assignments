    <h3>Extra! Extra! Newspapers are Dying</h3>
    <article>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">EVERYWHERE, World: </span>No one is surprised to learn that the newspaper industry is in structural decline.
            But the latest revenue numbers tell a scary story, with print ad revenue falling steeply even amid a healthy
            overall economic situation. This means things will get much, much worse when the next recession hits, and many
            newspapers could be forced out of business
            <b>altogether</b>.</p>

        <p>
            Advertising is a cyclical business. Revenue tends to go up during economic booms and then decline during recessions. So when
            newspapers ad revenues plunged in 2008 and 2009, many in the industry hoped this would prove a temporary setback
            and that they’d regain some of the lost ground once the economy recovered.
            <span class="italics">They haven't.</span>
            Instead, over the past six years the opposite has happened: Newspaper advertising revenues have continued to deteriorate
            even as the economy booms.

            <p> On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal announced that it was consolidating some sections of the newspaper to cope
                with dwindling ad sales. The transition to a slimmer paper will be aided by a round of buyouts the Journal
                announced last month. And the situation is even grimmer at smaller papers. For example, the Ithaca Journal
                in upstate New York announced today that it was laying off two editorial staffers, leaving a paper that once
                employed an editorial staff of more than 20 people with just two full-time reporters. Newspaper revenues
                are being dragged inexorably downward by two major forces. One is demographics. Older Americans are newspapers’
                most loyal readers, while people born after 1980 largely don’t subscribe to newspapers. So each year, a few
                million newspaper readers die and are not replaced by new readers.
            </p>
            <p> At the same time, an increasingly competitive ad market is making it harder and harder for newspapers to charge
                premium rates. In the 1990s, many cities had only one major newspaper, and that newspaper was often the best
                way for local businesses to reach customers. So newspapers could charge premium rates for ads.
            </p>
            <p> In 2015, print media accounted for 4 percent of people’s time but captured 16 percent of the ad revenue. In contrast,
                mobile devices captured a quarter of people’s time but only about one-eighth of ad spending. This situation
                can’t last. Over time, advertisers will realize that they can get more bang for their buck by advertising
                on new media platforms. And so newspaper ad revenue is likely to decline even more rapidly than its audience
                does.
